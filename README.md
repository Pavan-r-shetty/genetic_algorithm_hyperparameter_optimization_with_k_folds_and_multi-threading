# genetic_algorithm_hyperparameter_optimization_with_k_folds_and_multi-threading
This repository showcases an advanced approach to hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm. By implementing multithreading, the runtime has been reduced significantlyâ€”from 20 days down to just 3 days. Additionally, the optimization process has been enhanced with the k-fold technique, providing more reliable and robust results.
